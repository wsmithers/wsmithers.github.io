Hello! So nice to meet you 😁 Do you love *Statistics*, *Data Analytics*, and *Machine Learning*? If so, I'm glad we met. Growing up in the Bay Area exposed me to many of these disciplines inspiring me to study these topics in higher education. I am looking to use my background in information systems, statistics, and leadership to develop powerful solutions to complex problems. My goal is to pursue professional employment in data analytics, database programming/development, and data automation; especially interested in working within consulting, product, and supply chain areas. On the side, I'm passionate about teaching statistical concepts and theory, especially within the sub field of regression analysis.
